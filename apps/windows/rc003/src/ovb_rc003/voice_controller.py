"""Pure state machine deciding when to synthesize the voice hotkey edge.

The RC003 device autonomously tells the host when its own physical mic button
is pressed (ATVV control opcode 0x08) and when its audio stream stops
(opcode 0x00) - see atvv_session.py. This module only decides, given the
configured trigger mode, what host key action that should produce. It
performs no I/O itself, so it's fully unit testable; the actual SendInput
call lives in app.py.

Semantics (frozen by XRBM-018, replacing the XRBM-014 RETRY
P1 #4 fix below it - see the XRBM-014 round 2 replan-check finding
"Toggle release edge absent"):

- TOGGLE and TYPELESS modes issue a key TAP on mic-button-press (starting the configured
  host voice shortcut) and issue ANOTHER TAP when the session closes
  (turning that same OS-level toggle back off). TYPELESS wiring closes on the
  physical release edge; TOGGLE closes on the device's AUDIO_STOP. A single
  tap-only-on-press action (the previous XRBM-014 RETRY P1 #4 fix) avoided
  holding a modifier "stuck" for the duration of the stream, but left
  the host voice mode running indefinitely after the device stopped
  streaming, since the configured toggle shortcut needs a second press to
  turn back off.
- TYPELESS pairs those two taps with Right Alt, matching Typeless for
  Windows: one tap starts dictation and the second tap finishes it.
- HOLD mode still holds the key down for the duration of the stream:
  key-down on mic-button-press, key-up when the device's own AUDIO_STOP
  arrives.
- Both modes' cleanup is provable: reset() always reports whether a
  closing action (KEY_UP for HOLD, TAP for TOGGLE) is still owed, and
  never leaves the controller thinking a session is still active.

        KEY_UP should not stop the caller from retrying the release, and a
        failed TOGGLE-mode closing TAP should not be forgotten either. A
        caller passes exactly the ``VoiceHostAction`` that failed; any other
        value (e.g. ``TAP`` from a TOGGLE-mode opening press, which is never
        a closing action - see ``on_mic_button_pressed``) is a caller bug,
