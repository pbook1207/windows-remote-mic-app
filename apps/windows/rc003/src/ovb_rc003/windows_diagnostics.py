"""Qt-free "检查与修复" (check-and-repair) diagnostics (XRBM-031).

Every check below is a plain function returning a typed, stable
``CheckResult`` - no Tk/Qt import anywhere in this module, matching this
package's existing convention (``settings_ui.py``, ``remote_layout.py``,
``shell_targets.py``) of keeping business logic directly unit-testable
without constructing a window. ``qt_settings_app.py`` is the only place that
runs ``run_diagnostics()`` off the Qt GUI thread and renders its results.

Every check that touches a real OS/WinRT/PortAudio call accepts an
injectable override (a ``probe``/``discover``/``enumerate_*`` callable) so
its PASS/FAIL/MANUAL branching is exercised directly in tests on any OS,
while the real, uninjected default degrades to ``UNSUPPORTED`` off Windows
or when an optional dependency is missing - it never fabricates a result it
cannot actually observe (In-scope item 2/4's core honesty contract: a live
process or a paired device must never be reported as proof that buttons or
speech are working).

Raw Input and BLE candidate checks deliberately report only a COUNT/status,
never a device path or Bluetooth name/address - this module must not become
a second place that leaks the identifiers ``config.py``/``logging_setup.py``
already refuse to persist.

BLE candidate discovery (XRBM-035 RETRY 1) runs in a separate, disposable OS
process, not merely a background thread of this one - see the "-- BLE
candidate --" section below for why an in-process asyncio cancellation
cannot give a real hard bound against the locked pywinrt wrapper's own
unbounded post-cancel wait, and how process-level termination does.

# -- BLE candidate (voice bridge) -------------------------------------------
#
# XRBM-035 RETRY 1: the diagnostics-only BLE discovery below runs in a
# genuinely separate OS PROCESS, not merely a cancellable asyncio Task in
# this process. XRBM-035 round 1 tried the latter (cancel the asyncio Task
# wrapping discover_candidates(), relying on the locked pywinrt >=3.2
# asyncio-cancellation-propagates-to-WinRT documented behaviour) and an
# independent review found the real, locked winrt-runtime==3.2.1
# ``winrt/runtime/_internals.py::wrap_async()`` source:
#
#     except asyncio.CancelledError:
#         op.cancel()
#         await event.wait()   # <-- UNBOUNDED: waits for the native
#         raise                #     completion callback with no timeout
#
# ``IAsyncInfo.cancel()`` only REQUESTS cancellation (Microsoft's own ABI
# docs give no completion-time guarantee) - the Python-level ``await task``
# after calling ``task.cancel()`` can therefore still hang indefinitely
# waiting for a native completion callback that may never fire, which is
# exactly the real Windows CI 0xC0000005 crash this task chases: a
# same-process background thread still executing native WinRT code when the
# interpreter starts finalizing. No in-process asyncio timeout can bound an
# operation whose own cancellation primitive is itself unbounded.
#
# The only way to get a REAL, OS-enforced hard bound is process isolation:
# ``_run_ble_diagnostics_subprocess()`` spawns a disposable child process
# (this same interpreter re-invoked with a hidden flag - see
# ``build_ble_diagnostics_subprocess_command()``) that does the actual WinRT
# call; if it does not report back within ``BLE_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``,
# the parent terminates it and, if that alone is not confirmed within
# ``_SUBPROCESS_TERMINATE_WAIT_SECONDS``, escalates to a forceful kill and
# waits again - each step individually bounded, and each step's SUCCESS is
# verified via the child's confirmed exit (``Popen.wait()`` returning), not
# merely "we called terminate()". A forcefully-killed OS process cannot
# leave any native code running that could touch THIS interpreter's memory
# during ITS OWN finalization - the crash's precondition (a still-running
# native WinRT call sharing this process/interpreter) is structurally
# impossible once discovery lives in a separate process. This does NOT
# change ``ble_transport_winrt.discover_candidates()`` or the real BLE
# bridging session (``RC003BleSession``) at all - those still run entirely
# in-process, unchanged, for the actual bridge; only the DIAGNOSTICS-ONLY
# enumeration this module performs is isolated this way.
#
# IPC transport (XRBM-035 RETRY 1 correction - NOT stdout): a real
# PyInstaller ``console=False`` (windowed) build - which is exactly what
# ``build/RemoteMicRC003.spec`` produces - has ``sys.stdout``,
# ``sys.stderr`` AND ``sys.stdin`` set to ``None`` by the bootloader,
# unconditionally, even when a parent process redirects the child's OS-level
# std handles (see PyInstaller's own documentation, "Common issues and
# pitfalls" -> "windowed/noconsole application" section:
# https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/common-issues-and-pitfalls.html). A
# ``print()``-to-stdout IPC contract - what this section originally shipped
# - would raise ``AttributeError`` inside the FROZEN child the very first
# time it tried to report a result, defeating the whole design silently (the
# parent would just see a nonzero exit / no output and report a generic
# "error", masking that the mechanism never worked in a frozen build at
# all). Every value that crosses the process boundary therefore goes
# through a RESULT FILE instead: the parent creates a private, per-attempt
# temp directory (``tempfile.mkdtemp()`` - restricted to the owning user by
# construction on every platform this runs on) and passes the file path
# inside it to the child as a plain argv value; the child (which never
# touches ``sys.stdout``/``sys.stderr``/``sys.stdin`` anywhere in this
# module) writes ONE small, strictly-allow-listed JSON object to that path
# ATOMICALLY (write to a sibling temp file, then ``os.replace()``), and the
# parent reads it back only after the child's exit has already been
# confirmed. The parent ALWAYS deletes the temp directory afterward
# (``_discover_ble_candidates_sync()``'s own ``finally``), regardless of
# outcome.
#
# Content contract: ``{"verdict": "single_match" | "no_candidate" |
# "winrt_unavailable" | "error"}`` or ``{"verdict": "ambiguous", "count":
# N}`` (2 <= N <= ``_MAX_PLAUSIBLE_AMBIGUOUS_COUNT``) - and NOTHING else;
# the parent's parser (``_sanitize_verdict_payload()``) strictly allow-lists
# every key, type, and value and turns anything else into the same honest
# "error" a real in-child failure would have produced - it never trusts
# arbitrary file content enough to, say, allocate a candidate list sized by
# an attacker/corruption-controlled number. Never a device name, address,
# handle, or raw exception text - the name-matching decision
# (``identity.select_single_candidate()``) runs INSIDE the child, where real
# device names are visible; only the verdict/count ever crosses the process
# boundary. The child's stdout/stderr/stdin are all DEVNULL'd by the parent
# (belt-and-suspenders on top of never being read from in this module), so
# even an unexpected traceback from third-party code can never reach this

    observation - never merely because ``signal_fn()`` didn't raise.

    XRBM-035 RETRY 1 (Codex red evidence): ``proc.terminate()``/
    ``proc.kill()``/``proc.wait()`` can each raise an ``OSError``
    (``PermissionError`` was the exact case reproduced) that is neither a
    confirmed exit nor a ``TimeoutExpired`` - the previous version let such
    an exception escape this function as a raw, undifferentiated

    never reach its own honest ``BleDiscoverySubprocessShutdownUnconfirmedError``
    contract for exactly the case that contract exists for: "this process
    could not confirm the diagnostics subprocess actually stopped".

    Every process-control exception here is therefore treated
    conservatively as "not yet confirmed", never as "must have failed" or
    "must have succeeded": ``signal_fn()`` raising is swallowed (the
    process may already have exited in a race - ``ProcessLookupError`` on
    POSIX - or this process may simply lack permission to signal it either
    way, only a real ``wait()``/``poll()`` observation ever counts), and
    ``wait()`` raising anything other than ``TimeoutExpired`` falls back to
    one single, non-blocking ``poll()`` check (never a second unbounded
    wait) so a process that happens to have already exited despite
    ``wait()`` itself failing is still correctly recognized as confirmed.
    ``poll()`` itself is ALSO not trusted to never raise (it makes the same
    kind of OS process-query call as ``wait()``): if it does, that is
    ANOTHER "cannot confirm" outcome, not a crash - this function returns
    False rather than letting a second raw ``OSError`` escape. Still

    ``cancel_event`` (XRBM-035), when given, is forwarded only to the BLE
    candidate check's discovery call (the one real check with a native
    async WinRT call that can run long/hang - see
    ``_run_ble_diagnostics_subprocess()``): setting it from another thread
    (e.g. the settings window closing) cancels an in-flight discovery
    attempt in bounded time - via a real, OS-confirmed process termination,
    not merely an in-process asyncio cancellation request - instead of
    leaving it to run to completion or to an unbounded process exit.

    Every check is isolated (see ``_isolated()``): one check's unexpected
    failure can never prevent the other six from rendering their own real
    result - UNLESS ``cancel_event`` becomes set (XRBM-035 RETRY 1 P1 #2):
    once shutdown has been requested, this function stops running any
    FURTHER checks after whichever one just completed and returns
    immediately with only the checks completed so far. This report is about
    to be discarded unemitted anyway once shutdown has begun (see
    ``qt_settings_app.py``'s ``_run_in_background()``, which skips the emit
    entirely once ``_diagnostics_shutdown_event`` is set) - continuing to
    run the remaining checks after that point would only prolong how long
    the background worker thread takes to actually finish, for no
    observable benefit, working directly against the whole point of a
    bounded shutdown. With no ``cancel_event`` (the default), this early
    stop never triggers and all seven checks always run.
