"""``python -m ovb_rc003`` (or the packaged ``RemoteMicRC003.exe``,
built from the standalone ``src/launcher.py`` entry point - see XRBM-021):

- (no args)     open the settings window - the DEFAULT double-click
                behavior, so a user who runs the exe always sees a window.
                Never touches BLE/HID/audio or the single-instance guard.
- ``--settings``  open the settings window (explicit form of the default)
- ``--bridge``  run the bridge - guarded by a per-session Windows named-
                mutex (single_instance.py) so a second concurrent launch
                never starts BLE/HID/audio: it shows a visible notice and
                exits with a deterministic nonzero code instead of ever
                calling ``app.main()``. This guard FAILS CLOSED (XRBM-021
                review round 1 P1 #1): if the mutex API itself could not be
                used to prove single ownership - not just a confirmed
                duplicate - the bridge does not start either. A caller
                that cannot prove it is the only owner of BLE/HID/audio
                resources must never gamble on being one anyway.
- ``--dry-run``   import every first-party module and exit 0, touching no
                  GUI, BLE, Raw Input, or audio device - the safe smoke
                  check build-candidate.ps1 and
                  .github/workflows/windows-rc003-ci.yml run against a
                  freshly built artifact (XRBM-014 review RETRY P2 #3: a
                  build that produces an executable which cannot even be
                  launched is not caught by the PyInstaller build step
                  alone).
- ``--diagnose-ble-candidates <result-path>``  HIDDEN, undocumented in
                  ``--help`` on purpose (XRBM-035 RETRY 1): the settings
                  window's "检查与修复" page's BLE candidate check
                  re-invokes this same entry point (source:
                  ``sys.executable -m ovb_rc003 --diagnose-ble-candidates
                  <result-path>``; frozen build: the packaged .exe
                  re-invoked with just the flag + path - see
                  ``windows_diagnostics.build_ble_diagnostics_subprocess_
                  command()``) as a disposable CHILD PROCESS purely so the
                  parent can forcibly terminate/kill it with a real,
                  OS-confirmed hard bound if the native WinRT call it makes
                  never returns - something no in-process asyncio
                  cancellation can guarantee (see
                  ``windows_diagnostics.py``'s "-- BLE candidate --"
                  section for the full story). ``<result-path>`` is where
                  this process writes its ONE, strictly-shaped result JSON
                  file - NEVER stdout, which a real PyInstaller
                  ``console=False`` build sets to ``None`` (see that same
                  module section for the citation) - and a missing/empty
                  path here fails this branch CLOSED (a nonzero exit,
                  before ever attempting discovery, never a fallback
                  location and never falling through to running the
                  bridge). Never launched by a real end user directly; not
                  part of this program's public CLI surface.
- ``--help``/``-h``  print this usage and exit 0

``--settings``, ``--bridge``, ``--dry-run``,
``--diagnose-ble-candidates`` and ``--help``/``-h`` are all checked and
dispatched BEFORE the bridge branch below is ever reached, so none of them
touch the single-instance mutex at all (XRBM-021 changed threat model: the
guard applies only to the ``--bridge`` mode).
