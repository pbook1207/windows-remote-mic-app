"""Real Win32 input for ordinary actions and the voice shortcut.

Windows-only. Kept as thin as possible and separated from win32_keys.py's
pure VK-code resolution so the mapping logic stays unit-testable everywhere
while only the actual syscall needs ctypes/user32.

Batching/rollback contract (fixed after XRBM-014 review RETRY P1 #4 - see
XRBM-014's independent review; extended by XRBM-019/XRBM-020 - see
XRBM-019's independent review): a multi-key combo is submitted to
``SendInput`` as a single batched call (one array, one syscall) rather than
one call per key, so there is only one narrow window in which a partial
delivery could happen at all. If ``SendInput`` reports it queued fewer
events than requested, the exact keys that *did* go down are immediately
released before the failure is raised. A generic exception raised by the
sender AFTER submission is treated the same way - delivery is unknown, not
"nothing landed" - so every key that may still be down gets its own
best-effort release attempt before the failure is raised too. This applies
to all three combo helpers, including the cleanup-path ``send_key_combo_up``:
its failures (partial or generic) are best-effort retried and then RAISED as
an observable ``OSError``, never swallowed - the sole exception is
``Win32InputUnavailableError`` ("not running on Windows"), a pre-submission
platform-availability signal re-raised as-is with no rollback attempted,
since nothing could have landed.

Testability: every public function accepts an optional ``_sender`` keyword
(a callable matching ``RawSender``) used only by tests. Production callers
never pass it, so the real ``ctypes``/``user32.SendInput`` path is used -
but tests/test_win32_input_batching.py can inject a fake sender that
simulates partial delivery and assert the exact rollback calls that result,
without needing ``ctypes.windll`` (which does not exist off Windows) at all.
