"""WinRT-based BLE transport: RC003 discovery and the ATVV GATT connection.

Windows-only. The 0.2.0 release completed live RC003 pairing, reconnect and
ATVV voice acceptance; repository automation still never pairs with or
controls a physical device. Importing this
module never fails without the optional ``winrt-Windows.*`` packages
installed; only calling its async functions does, with a clear error.

Dependency closure (XRBM-024): ``discover_candidates()``'s
``find_all_async_aqs_filter()`` call returns a
``Windows.Foundation.IAsyncOperation``, and iterating the resulting
``DeviceInformationCollection`` uses a ``Windows.Foundation.Collections``
``IIterator`` - both projections are exact ``3.2.1`` pins in
requirements.txt and PyInstaller hidden imports even though this module
never imports either module by name (see ``_import_winrt()``, which
imports both explicitly purely to turn a missing pin into this module's own
``WinRTUnavailableError`` instead of a raw ``ModuleNotFoundError`` from
inside an awaited coroutine).

WinRT call surface (fixed after XRBM-014 review RETRY P1 #1, and again after
review round 2 P1 #2 - see XRBM-014's independent review): every
call below is written to match the locked ``winrt-Windows.*==3.2.1``
Python projection's actual signatures rather than the earlier,
deterministically-wrong drafts:

- Discovery uses ``BluetoothLEDevice.get_device_selector_from_pairing_state(True)``
  (a synchronous static method on ``BluetoothLEDevice``, not
  ``GattDeviceService``) passed to
  ``DeviceInformation.find_all_async_aqs_filter(selector)`` (the locked
  3.2.1 stubs expose the AQS-filtered overload under this distinct method
  name, not as a second positional argument on the no-arg
  ``find_all_async()``). This is the fix for round 2 P1 #2: the previous
  draft got a ``DeviceInformation.id`` from
  ``GattDeviceService.get_device_selector_from_uuid()``, which enumerates
  GATT *service-instance* paths - a different WinRT ID domain from the BLE
  *device* ID ``BluetoothLEDevice.from_id_async()`` requires. Every
  ``DeviceInformation.id`` this module ever calls ``from_id_async`` with now
  comes exclusively from the paired-BLE-device selector.
- After ``from_id_async`` opens the device, ``connect()`` still calls
  ``get_gatt_services_for_uuid_async`` for the ATVV voice service UUID and
  raises if it is absent - this is the "verify the ATVV service after
  opening" half of the same fix: a device that happens to answer
  ``from_id_async`` but does not expose the ATVV service is rejected here,
  not assumed compatible just because discovery found it.
- Every GATT UUID is converted to ``uuid.UUID`` before being passed to
  ``get_gatt_services_for_uuid_async``/``get_characteristics_for_uuid_async``
  - the projection requires a real ``uuid.UUID``, not a string.
- ``write_value_with_result_async`` returns a ``GattWriteResult`` object;
  its ``.status`` attribute is compared to ``GattCommunicationStatus``, not
  the result object itself.
- Notification subscriptions are tracked by the ``EventRegistrationToken``
  that ``add_value_changed``/``add_connection_status_changed`` return, and
  cleanup calls ``remove_value_changed``/``remove_connection_status_changed``
  with that exact token - not with the original callback.
- ``close()`` writes the CCCD value back to ``NONE`` on both subscribed
  characteristics, removes both notification handlers and the connection-
  status handler by token, then closes the ``GattDeviceService`` and the
  ``BluetoothLEDevice`` (both implement ``IClosable``).
- ``BluetoothLEDevice.add_connection_status_changed`` is wired so a real
  disconnect is observed and reported via ``on_disconnected`` instead of the
  session silently waiting forever - see connection_supervisor.py for how
  app.py turns that into a reconnect.

These signatures have been exercised against the locked wheel, a live WinRT
runtime and real RC003 hardware during 0.2.0 acceptance. tests/test_ble_transport_contract.py
exercises this module's call shape (method names, argument types, token
plumbing) against an in-repo fake WinRT projection that mimics the same
signatures, so at least internal consistency is covered by an automated,
cross-platform test; CI still cannot replace release-time real-hardware
verification on representative Windows systems.

Threading/blocking (XRBM-014 review RETRY P1 #4 / P2 audio threading): the
notification callbacks WinRT invokes (``_handle_control_notification``,
``_handle_audio_notification``) do nothing but a non-blocking, bounded,
drop-oldest-on-full queue push. A single dedicated worker thread (not the
thread WinRT invoked the callback on) pulls from that queue, decodes ATVV
audio/control frames through the (single-threaded-by-design)
``atvv_session.ATVVSession``, and forwards results to ``on_pcm_frame``/
``on_control_event``. Queued items are tagged with a per-``connect()``
generation counter; the worker drops any item whose generation doesn't
match the current one, so audio/control events queued by a previous,
already-torn-down session can never be processed after a reconnect.
