"""Launches the bridge process from the settings window (XRBM-029), and
reports what actually happened - not just "a process was created". This
module never conflates a launched/still-running process with "RC003 is
connected": that fact is only observable from ``app.log`` (see
``logging_setup.py``), never from process liveness alone.

Command construction (``build_launch_command``) covers exactly the two ways
this package's own entry point (``__main__.py``) is ever invoked, so a
future third mode cannot silently fall through unnoticed:

- **Frozen** (the packaged ``RemoteMicRC003.exe``, built from
  ``src/launcher.py`` - see that module's docstring): ``sys.executable`` IS
  that same exe, and running it again with ``--bridge`` enters
  ``__main__.main()``'s ``_run_bridge()`` branch. The no-argument form now
  opens the settings window, so the bridge is always launched EXPLICITLY -
  never ``--settings``, which would just open a second settings window
  instead of starting the bridge.
- **Source** (``python -m ovb_rc003``): ``sys.executable`` is the
  interpreter itself; ``[sys.executable, "-m", "ovb_rc003", "--bridge"]``
  enters the same bridge branch. This relies on the child inheriting the
  parent process's environment (``subprocess.Popen`` does this by default) -
  in particular ``PYTHONPATH=src``, which the settings window's own process
  needed to have been started with in order to import ``ovb_rc003`` at all
  (see the root README's "Running from source" section).

Both branches deliberately append ``--bridge`` and never ``--settings``:
that argument would recursively open another settings window instead of
starting the bridge (In-scope item 2's "不得递归打开 --settings").

Launch-outcome detection (``launch_bridge``) distinguishes four states by
polling the child for a short grace period rather than assuming
"``Popen()`` did not raise" means "the bridge is running":

- ``STARTED``: the process is still alive once the grace period elapses -
  the best evidence available from process state alone that startup is
  proceeding, NOT proof of an RC003 connection.
- ``ALREADY_RUNNING``: the process exited within the grace period with
  exactly ``single_instance.DUPLICATE_INSTANCE_EXIT_CODE`` - the
  single-instance guard in ``single_instance.py``/``__main__.py`` refused a
  second concurrent bridge instance. Reusing that exact constant (rather
  than redefining a second one here) keeps the two modules from silently
  drifting apart if the exit code is ever renumbered.
- ``QUICK_EXIT``: the process exited within the grace period with any OTHER
  code (including ``GUARD_UNAVAILABLE_EXIT_CODE``/``CLEANUP_FAILED_EXIT_CODE``
  or an unhandled exception's implicit ``1``) - a real failure, whose exact
  code is always surfaced to the caller rather than swallowed, so a user or
  reviewer can distinguish it from a clean exit without guessing.
- ``LAUNCH_FAILED``: ``Popen()`` itself raised ``OSError`` (e.g. the target
  executable is missing or not executable) - no process was ever created at
  all.

Testability: every OS-facing call (``_popen``, ``_sleep``) is injectable, so
tests/test_bridge_launcher.py drives all four outcomes deterministically -
including the grace-period polling loop - without spawning a real process or
sleeping in real wall-clock time, the same dependency-injection pattern this
package's other Win32-facing modules already use (see e.g.
``single_instance.py``'s ``_create_mutex``/``_release_mutex``/
``_close_handle`` parameters).
