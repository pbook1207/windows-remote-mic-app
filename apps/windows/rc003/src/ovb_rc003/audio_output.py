"""User-selected audio output endpoint resolution, with a strict fail-closed
policy: voice never falls back to the system default device.

Enumeration and PCM playback (Windows-only, via the ``sounddevice`` package)
are separated from the selection logic below so the selection/fail-closed
contract is unit-testable on any OS without the real dependency installed.

This module never changes which device Windows considers "default" for
anything; it only ever writes PCM to the one endpoint the user explicitly
picked in the settings UI, by name, each time a voice session starts.
