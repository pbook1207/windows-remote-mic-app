"""Generic connect/run/cleanup/retry loop, decoupled from any concrete BLE,
HID, or audio backend so it is unit-testable with fake async callables (see
tests/test_connection_supervisor.py) rather than requiring real hardware or
a live WinRT/hidapi/PortAudio runtime.

Added after XRBM-014 review RETRY P1 #2: the previous app.py connected once
and waited forever, with no reconnect loop and no guarantee that cleanup ran
on every failure path. This module makes both properties structural:

- ``cleanup`` always runs after every ``connect``/``wait`` attempt, whether
  that attempt succeeded, raised, or was ended by ``request_reconnect()`` -
  it is the only ``finally`` in the loop body.
- A failed or ended attempt always leads to another ``connect`` attempt
  (after ``retry_delay``), until ``stop()`` is called.

Thread safety (fixed after XRBM-014 review round 2 P1 #5): ``asyncio.Event``
is documented as not thread-safe - only code running on the event loop's own
thread may call ``.set()`` directly. ``request_reconnect()`` is invoked from
WinRT/worker-thread callbacks (a BLE disconnect notification, an ATVV
protocol error decoded on ble_transport_winrt.py's worker thread, a failed
audio-playback write), so it now always hops onto the owning loop via
``loop.call_soon_threadsafe()`` instead of mutating the event directly.
