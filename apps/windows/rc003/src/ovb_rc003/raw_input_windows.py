"""Windows Raw Input adapter for the RC003's ordinary buttons.

Replaces the earlier hidapi-based adapter (removed after XRBM-014 review
RETRY P1 #5: opening the BLE HID-over-GATT collection directly with hidapi
does not match how the upstream reference project actually reads ordinary
RC003 buttons on Windows, and this implementation must not claim "hidapi reads
all 12 keys" without evidence). This module instead uses the standard
Win32 Raw Input API (``RegisterRawInputDevices``/``WM_INPUT``), which is
the mechanism the cited upstream project's own ``raw_input_bridge.py`` is
built on for its (different) supported device family.

Device scoping: every Raw Input event is filtered by the *device path* of
the physical HID collection that produced it (``GetRawInputDeviceInfoW``
with ``RIDI_DEVICENAME``), matched against the RC003 VID/PID via
``hid_identity.device_path_matches_rc003``. Before starting the listener,
``enumerate_matching_device_paths()`` lists every currently attached
Raw-Input-visible device path and ``hid_identity.select_single_device_path``
fails closed (raises) if zero or more than one match - this replaces the
previous "return the first match" behavior.

ENVIRONMENT-SPECIFIC FALLBACK DETAILS (the combined 0.2.0 button pipeline was
accepted on real hardware, but a particular Raw Input collection shape can
still vary by Windows and Bluetooth adapter):

Windows delivers Raw Input events in two shapes, and which shape a given
BLE HID-over-GATT collection actually produces for THIS device has not been
verified against real hardware:

- ``RIM_TYPEKEYBOARD``: an already-translated keyboard event (a VK code +
  up/down flag). Windows only produces this for HID Keyboard-page usages it
  recognizes and has a standard VK translation for. ``KEYBOARD_VK_TO_BUTTON``
  below covers the RC003 buttons whose HID usage IDs have standard or
  real-device-observed Windows VK translations (arrows, Enter, Home,
  Application/Menu, microphone as F5, TV as OEM_3, power as Sleep, and the
  three keyboard-page volume usages). The "back" button's usage (0x00F1)
  is known from upstream's own research to fall outside the translated
  range entirely (see frida_compat.py), so it may produce no event via
  this path; that is a safe/inert failure (the button does nothing) rather
  than a crash.
- ``RIM_TYPEHID``: raw, untranslated report bytes, decodable via
  ``hid_identity.decode_active_usages``. Windows only takes this path for
  usage pages it does not have a specific input-class driver for. Whether
  the RC003's BLE HID collection is exposed this way at all - and, if so,
  under which registered usage page - varies by environment; this path is
  kept as defense-in-depth and does no harm if it never fires.

Importing this module never fails on a machine without the Win32 APIs
available; only starting the listener does, with a clear error.

    Device scoping happens on every event (not just at registration time,
    since Raw Input registration itself has no per-device-instance filter -
    see RIDEV/RAWINPUTDEVICE in Microsoft's documentation): every event's
    resolved device path must equal (after normalization) the *exact* single
    path ``start()`` was given - not merely re-match the RC003 VID/PID -
    fixed after XRBM-014 review round 2 P1 #4: a second matching RC003
    collection/device that appeared after startup would previously also be
    accepted.

    Stop semantics (fixed after XRBM-014 review round 2 P1 #3): Microsoft's
    own documentation states ``WM_QUIT`` is not associated with a window and
    must not be posted with ``PostMessage``. ``stop()`` instead posts the
    ordinary, window-associated ``WM_CLOSE``; the window procedure's
    ``WM_CLOSE`` handler calls ``DestroyWindow``, whose synchronous
    ``WM_DESTROY`` handler (running on the same message-loop thread, per
    Win32's ``SendMessage``-style destroy-notification contract) is the one
    that calls ``PostQuitMessage`` - the only Windows-sanctioned way to make
    ``GetMessageW`` return 0 and end the loop.

    Window class lifecycle (XRBM-018 RETRY 1 P1 #2): every ``start()`` call
    registers a freshly-generated, unique window class name (not the same
    process-wide literal every time), so a second ``start()`` can never
    collide with ``RegisterClassW`` failing with
    ``ERROR_CLASS_ALREADY_EXISTS`` even if a previous run's class somehow
    was never unregistered. ``_run()`` still explicitly calls
    ``UnregisterClassW`` once its window is destroyed (on every exit path,
    including a startup failure after ``RegisterClassW`` succeeded), so
    classes don't accumulate indefinitely across many reconnect cycles
    either - the unique name is defense in depth, not a substitute for
    actually unregistering.

    Honest thread-liveness bookkeeping (XRBM-018 RETRY 1 P1 #2): ``stop()``
    and a failed/timed-out ``start()`` both join the background thread with
    a bounded timeout, but if the thread is genuinely still alive afterward,
    ``self._thread``/``self._hwnd`` are deliberately left populated instead
    of being cleared - clearing them would make ``is_running`` silently
    report ``False`` for a thread (and its window/message loop) that is
    still actually running, which is exactly the failure mode this fixes.
    ``stop()`` raises in that case instead of returning as if it succeeded.
