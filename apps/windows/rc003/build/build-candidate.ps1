#requires -Version 5.1

.SYNOPSIS
    Builds an unsigned Remote Mic · RC003 candidate on Windows.

    Steps: create/activate a virtual environment, install
    requirements-dev.txt, run the public-boundary scan, run the test suite
    (gated with ``-W error::ResourceWarning``, matching the CI workflow),
    invoke PyInstaller against RemoteMicRC003.spec, then smoke-check
    the built executable with ``--dry-run`` (imports every module, touches
    no GUI/BLE/HID/audio, exits 0) so a broken build is caught here rather
    than only discovered on a real machine.

    Does NOT fetch Frida Gadget, does NOT request elevation, and does NOT
    sign the resulting binary. The optional VB-CABLE helper is downloaded
    only by the explicit, hash-pinned fetch step below.

    Exit-code gating (XRBM-014 review RETRY P2 #3): PowerShell's
    ``$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"`` only turns PowerShell-cmdlet errors
    into terminating errors - a NATIVE command (venv creation, pip, python,
    PyInstaller, the built .exe itself) can exit non-zero without PowerShell
    treating that as an error at all, letting the script silently continue
    past a real failure. Every native invocation below is followed by an
    explicit ``$LASTEXITCODE`` check via ``Assert-LastExitCode``.

.PARAMETER PythonExecutable
    Python interpreter to create the virtual environment with. Defaults to
    "py -3.12" if available, else "python".

.PARAMETER VenvPath
    Virtual-environment path. Defaults to ``.venv``. A short absolute path is
    useful on Windows machines without Long Paths enabled because Qt's wheel
    contains deeply nested QML build metadata.
