# PyInstaller spec for Remote Mic · RC003 on Windows.
#
# One-dir build (COLLECT), matching the layout pattern this project's
# upstream reference uses for its own standalone products, minus everything
# out of scope for this candidate: no other-device (T1/V60) code, and no
# licensing/DRM modules (none exist in this tree to begin with). The optional,
# hash-verified Frida archive is bundled only when the explicit fetch step
# placed it in the source tree; it is never downloaded by this spec.
#
# Build with (inside a Windows virtual environment with requirements-dev.txt
# installed):
#   pyinstaller build/RemoteMicRC003.spec
#
# This produces an UNSIGNED candidate under dist/RemoteMicRC003/. Real
# code signing is not currently configured for this community build.
